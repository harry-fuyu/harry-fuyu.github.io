Check out my article about my experience during the time of Covid-19 on [Medium](https://medium.com/@fu_yu_6553/memoir-for-the-time-of-covid-19-part-i-january-to-march-dcc3a793be75)!

### What is your life trajectory so far?
I grew up in Hangzhou, a beautiful and serene city in southeast China. When I was 15, I took on a government scholarship and went to highschool (ACSI) in Singapore. After four years in the one and only Garden City, I miraculously received an offer from Harvard to study applied mathematics. Now I settled on Neuroscience and I'm pursuing Master's Degree in statistics concurrently.

### What's your academic interest?
My research interest lies in the intersection between neuroscience, cognitive science, and deep learning. In particular, I'm facinated by similarities between the performance of deep learning models and a human subject on various levels. For more info, please visit my research page, and please check out my blog series on Neuro & AI.

### What's your personal interest?
I love playing the piano for my own leisure:) My favorite composers are Chopin and Mozart. Currently I'm venturing my way into Chopin's Winterwind Etude. Fingers crossed (no pun intended) that I could make it through! 

I'm also the music director, bass and accompanist for the Harvard Noteables. We dedicate to bring the best broadway show tunes to Harvard campus! Check out our [youtube site](https://www.youtube.com/user/HarvardNoteables).

Additionally I'm a huge soccer fan, so huge that I don't have a favorite team, but just for soccer itself. I have also been playing the Football Manager series since 2014 and I know way too many players even in the lower level leagues:)

### How do you see yourself in the future far far away?
I would definitely open my own restaurant/bar someday on a sunny, relaxing beach (CA? SG? Cuba?). In my opinion, cooking requires multiple levels of imagination and the vast possibilities just fascinate me.
#### Level 1: Mixing in mind
Which ingredients/condiments would go well with which other ingredients/condiments? (Imagine it!!!) Chopped ladyfinger fried with eggs, served with white pepper? Humm I wonder why no one has tried this before... 
#### Level 2: Execution
Everything to me is an optimization problem, cooking included. How to make all dishes within the shortest amount of time? With beef brisket stewing with tomatos and potatos in my pot, I'm chopping the freshest veggies while the water is boiling in kettle. I imagine the whole workflow in my head once before I put on my apron:)
